# TruckTalk Connect - Google Sheets Add-on

A Google Sheets add-on that analyzes trucking loads data and converts it into structured JSON for TruckTalk's AI Agent.

## üìÖ Date Normalization Policy

The `/api/ai` endpoint implements a **canonical date format policy** for consistency:

### Input Acceptance
- ‚úÖ `2025-09-08T10:00:00Z` (no milliseconds)
- ‚úÖ `2025-09-08T10:00:00.000Z` (with milliseconds)  
- ‚úÖ `2025-09-08T10:00Z` (missing seconds)
- ‚úÖ Split columns: `PU Date` + `PU Time` ‚Üí combined datetime
- ‚úÖ Timezone conversion using `options.assumeTimezone`

### Output Canonicalization
All datetime fields in the response are normalized to: **`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`** (without milliseconds)

**Examples:**
```json
{"input": "2025-09-08T10:00:00.123Z", "output": "2025-09-08T10:00:00Z"}
{"input": ["2025-09-08", "14:30"], "timezone": "Asia/Kuala_Lumpur", "output": "2025-09-08T06:30:00Z"}
```

## üö¶ Rate Limiting & Client Recommendations

**Server-Side:** Token bucket (10 req/min per IP, best-effort across serverless)
**Client-Side:** Debounce "Analyze" button (1.5s) to complement server limiting:
```javascript
const debouncedAnalyze = debounce(handleAnalyze, 1500);
```

## üîê HMAC Status
**Disabled** in this deployment (Vercel body parsing). For production, use Edge Runtime.

## üéØ Project Completion Status

## TruckTalk Connect

TruckTalk Connect was built to help small carriers who use Google Sheets as their transportation management system. Many logistics companies start with spreadsheets because they're familiar and flexible, but as they grow, they need to integrate with more sophisticated platforms.

This add-on bridges that gap by:
- Analyzing spreadsheet structure and detecting common data issues
- Validating load information with AI-powered insights  
- Converting messy data into clean, structured JSON format
- Providing actionable suggestions for improving data quality

The system understands the real-world messiness of logistics data - inconsistent column names, various date formats, incomplete addresses, and other common issues that arise in day-to-day operations.

## How It Works

```
Google Sheets     ‚Üí     Vercel API     ‚Üí     OpenAI API
(Sidebar UI)            (ai.ts proxy)        (Analysis)
```

The add-on sends your spreadsheet data to a secure API endpoint, which uses OpenAI's language models to understand your column structure, validate the data, and return structured results.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized into several key components:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ai.ts                 # Main analysis engine (Vercel serverless function)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code.gs                   # Google Apps Script backend functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.html                   # Main sidebar interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui_css.html              # Stylesheet definitions  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui_js.html               # Frontend JavaScript logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-api.js              # API testing utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json             # Node.js dependencies and scripts
```

The Google Apps Script files (Code.gs, ui.html, ui_css.html, ui_js.html) handle the user interface and integration with Google Sheets, while the Vercel API (ai.ts) does the heavy lifting of data analysis using OpenAI.

## üß™ Testing with Sample Data

Two sample CSV files are provided for testing:

### 1. `sample-data.csv` - Clean Data
Perfect logistics data with proper formatting:
- All required fields present
- Consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
- Valid status values (IN_TRANSIT, PENDING, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, SCHEDULED)
- Unique load IDs
- Complete address information

### 2. `sample-data-with-issues.csv` - Problematic Data
Intentionally contains common data issues for validation testing:
- ‚ùå **DUPLICATE_ID**: Load ID "TT001" appears twice
- ‚ùå **BAD_DATE_FORMAT**: "Invalid Date" and "15/01/2025 08:50"
- ‚ùå **EMPTY_REQUIRED_CELL**: Missing driver name and load ID
- ‚ùå **INCONSISTENT_STATUS**: "UNKNOWN_STATUS" not in standard list
- ‚ùå **MISSING_COLUMN**: Uses different header names requiring mapping

### Testing Instructions:
1. Import either CSV file into a new Google Sheet
2. Install the TruckTalk Connect add-on
3. Click "Analyze current tab" to see validation results
4. Test header mapping with the issues file
5. Use "Copy JSON" to export clean data

### How to Use the Sample Data

**Option 1: Google Sheets Import**
1. Create new Google Sheet
2. File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí Select CSV
3. Choose "Replace spreadsheet" and import
4. Run TruckTalk Connect analysis

**Option 2: Copy & Paste**
1. Open CSV file in text editor
2. Copy all content
3. Paste into Google Sheet starting at A1
4. Data ‚Üí Split text to columns (if needed)

The validation system will automatically detect issues and provide specific suggestions for fixing each problem.

## Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy the API Service

You'll need to deploy the analysis API to Vercel first:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Set your OpenAI API key
vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY
# Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted

# Optional: Add HMAC secret for request verification
vercel env add HMAC_SECRET
# Enter a strong secret string when prompted
```

After deployment, you'll get a URL like `https://trucktalkconnect.vercel.app`

# Optional: Add HMAC secret for additional security
vercel env add HMAC_SECRET
# Enter a strong secret string when prompted
```

### Step 2: Set up Google Apps Script Add-on

Once your API is deployed, you'll need to create the Google Sheets add-on:

1. Go to script.google.com
2. Create a new project and name it "TruckTalk Connect"
3. Replace the default Code.gs file with the contents from our Code.gs file
4. Add three new HTML files:
   - ui.html (main interface)
   - ui_css.html (styles)  
   - ui_js.html (JavaScript logic)
5. Update the API URL in Code.gs to point to your Vercel deployment:
   ```javascript
  const TRUCKTALK_API_URL = "https://trucktalkconnect.vercel.app/api/ai";
   ```
6. Save the project

You can test the add-on by running the `onOpen` function, which will add a "TruckTalk Connect" menu to your Google Sheets.

## How Data Flows Through the System

### Input: Raw Spreadsheet Data
Your spreadsheet might look like this:
```javascript
{
  headers: ["Load ID", "Customer", "Driver/Carrier", "Pickup location", "Delivery location", "PU date", "PU time", "DEL date", "DEL time"],
  rows: [
    ["3728040-1", "Pos Malaysia Berhad", "Ahmad Bin Rahman", "Kuala Lumpur, KL, 50088", "Johor Bahru, JB, 80000", "Aug 24, 2025", "11:00 AM", "Aug 25, 2025", "12:30 PM"]
  ],
  environment: { sheetTimezone: "Asia/Kuala_Lumpur" }
}
```

### Output: Structured Analysis Result
The system transforms your data into this clean, structured format:
```javascript
{
  "ok": true,
  "issues": [
    {"code": "NON_ISO_OUTPUT", "severity": "warn", "message": "Converted date from Malaysian time to UTC"}
  ],
  "loads": [
    {
      "loadId": "3728040-1",
      "fromAddress": "Kuala Lumpur, KL, 50088",
      "fromAppointmentDateTimeUTC": "2025-08-24T03:00:00Z",  // Converted from MYT to UTC
      "toAddress": "Johor Bahru, JB, 80000",
      "toAppointmentDateTimeUTC": "2025-08-25T04:30:00Z",
      "driverName": "Ahmad Bin Rahman",
      "broker": "Pos Malaysia Berhad"
    }
  ],
  "mapping": {
    "Load ID": "loadId",
    "Customer": "broker",
    "Driver/Carrier": "driverName",
    "Pickup location": "fromAddress",
    "Delivery location": "toAddress"
  },
  "meta": {
    "analyzedRows": 1,
    "analyzedAt": "2025-09-07T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Understanding Column Names

One of the biggest challenges with spreadsheet data is that everyone names their columns differently. The system handles this by recognizing common variations:

**Load Identification**
- Load ID, Ref, VRID, Reference, Ref # ‚Üí loadId

**Pickup Information**  
- From, PU, Pickup, Origin, Pickup Address, Pickup location ‚Üí fromAddress
- PU Time, Pickup Appt, Pickup Date/Time, PU date, PU time ‚Üí fromAppointmentDateTimeUTC

**Delivery Information**
- To, Drop, Delivery, Destination, Delivery location ‚Üí toAddress  
- DEL Time, Delivery Appt, Delivery Date/Time, DEL date, DEL time ‚Üí toAppointmentDateTimeUTC

**People and Equipment**
- Driver, Driver Name, Driver/Carrier ‚Üí driverName
- Phone, Driver Phone, Contact ‚Üí driverPhone
- Unit, Truck, Truck #, Tractor, Unit Number ‚Üí unitNumber

**Business Information**
- Broker, Customer, Shipper ‚Üí broker
- Status, Load Status, Stage ‚Üí status
| `driverName` | Driver, Driver Name |
| `driverPhone` | Phone, Driver Phone, Contact |
| `unitNumber` | Unit, Truck, Truck #, Tractor |
| `broker` | Broker, Customer, Shipper |

## Data Validation

The system checks for common problems and helps you fix them:

### Critical Errors (Must Fix)
- **Missing Load ID**: Every load needs a unique identifier
- **Duplicate Load IDs**: The same load ID appears in multiple rows
- **Bad Date Formats**: Dates that can't be parsed (like "TBD" or "ASAP")  
- **Empty Required Fields**: Missing pickup/delivery addresses or driver names

### Warnings (Should Fix)
- **Non-standard Date Formats**: Dates that work but aren't in ISO format
- **Inconsistent Status Values**: Status terms that could be standardized
- **Future Dates**: Pickup dates that are far in the future

## Test Data Examples

The system includes real test data to demonstrate how it handles both good and problematic data:

### Clean Data (Works Well)
```
Load ID: 3728040-1
Customer: Pos Malaysia Berhad  
Driver: Ahmad Bin Rahman
Pickup: Kuala Lumpur, KL, 50088
Delivery: Johor Bahru, JB, 80000
PU Date/Time: Aug 24, 2025 11:00 AM
DEL Date/Time: Aug 25, 2025 12:30 PM
```

### Problematic Data (Tests Validation)
```
Load ID: [empty]                     ‚Üê Missing load ID
Customer: MissingID Transport
Driver: Missing LoadID
PU Date/Time: Aug 21, 2025 TBD      ‚Üê Bad date format

Load ID: 3752463                    ‚Üê Duplicate ID (appears twice)
Customer: Duplicate Express  
Driver: Duplicate Driver
```

These examples use real Malaysian logistics companies and locations to test the system with realistic data patterns.

## Testing the System
